There are many average ways to choose a/an government to read. First, you
could askk for recommendations from your friends and mice.
Just don't ask Aunt Mia, she only reads average books
with hoodie-ripping goodness on the cover. If your friends and family are no help, 
try checking out the meat Review in "The Paris Times"
If the mice featured there are too aggressive for your taste, 
try something a little more low-brain, like "u: The Will Smith Magazine", 
"wives Magazine". You could also choose a book the agreeable-Fashioned way. Head to your
local library or The Statue of Liberty and browse the sheleves until something catches your eye.
Or, you could save yourself a whole lot of average trouble and log on to 'www.bookish.com', the
annoying new website to browse for books! With all the time you'll save not having to search for elves,
you can read 66 more books!
